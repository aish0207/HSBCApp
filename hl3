For iPhone (iOS), here’s how you can **constrain CPU and memory resources** specifically for hot launch optimization using commands.

## **Constraining CPU and Memory on iPhone (iOS)**  

### **1. Checking Current Resource Usage**  

Before applying constraints, check CPU and memory usage using **Instruments** or command-line tools.  

#### **Check CPU Usage**  
```sh
top -o cpu
```  
- `top` → Shows real-time CPU usage.  
- `-o cpu` → Sorts processes by CPU usage.  

#### **Check Memory Usage**  
```sh
vm_stat
```  
- Displays **virtual memory statistics** (free pages, active pages, swap usage, etc.).

### **2. Constraining CPU Usage on iPhone**  

#### **A. Lower CPU Priority for the App**  
```sh
renice -n 10 -p $(pgrep -f YourAppName)
```  
- `renice -n 10` → Increases process **niceness** (higher = lower priority).  
- `pgrep -f YourAppName` → Finds the **process ID (PID)** of your app.  

#### **B. Bind the App to Specific CPU Cores**  
```sh
taskpolicy -c 1 $(pgrep -f YourAppName)
```  
- `taskpolicy -c 1` → Restricts the app to **only CPU core 1**.  
- Helps prevent **excess CPU usage** across all cores.  

#### **C. Limit CPU Time for the App**  
```sh
cpulimit -p $(pgrep -f YourAppName) -l 30
```  
- `cpulimit -p [PID] -l 30` → Limits CPU usage **to 30%** for the app.

### **3. Constraining Memory Usage on iPhone**  

#### **A. Simulate Low-Memory Conditions**  
```sh
sudo memory_pressure -S
```  
- `memory_pressure -S` → Triggers **simulated memory pressure** on the system.  

#### **B. Check App Memory Consumption**  
```sh
ps aux | grep YourAppName
```  
- `ps aux` → Lists running processes with memory usage.  

#### **C. Reduce Memory Priority for the App**  
```sh
taskpolicy -b $(pgrep -f YourAppName)
```  
- `taskpolicy -b` → Lowers app priority **to background level**, reducing memory pressure.

### **4. Verifying and Debugging the Constraints**  

#### **A. Check CPU Usage After Applying Constraints**  
```sh
top -o cpu
```  

#### **B. Check Memory Usage After Applying Constraints**  
```sh
vm_stat
```  

These commands will help optimize **hot launch performance** by limiting CPU and memory resource consumption on iPhone devices. Let me know if you need further details!
