### **Phase 1: App Build Management Portal (Similar to Microsoft App Center, Basic Features Only)**  

1. **Project-Wise Groups & Access Control:**  
   - Each project will have a dedicated group (e.g., "Project ABC") for build management.  
   - Only members of a specific project group can upload and manage builds within their group.  
   - Users outside the group will not have upload access to ensure strict project isolation.  

2. **App Build Upload & Storage:**  
   - Users can upload Android (.apk, .aab) and iOS (.ipa) builds to a centralized portal.  
   - Versioning support to track different releases efficiently.  
   - Upload permission will be restricted to authorized users only.  

3. **Strict File Naming & Format Restrictions:**  
   - No duplicate build names allowed to prevent confusion and overwrites.  
   - Only **.apk, .aab, and .ipa** files are allowed; other file types are restricted.  

4. **Build Upload Limit Per Project:**  
   - Each project will have a defined limit on the number of builds that can be uploaded.  
   - This prevents excessive uploads that could overload lab servers and storage.  
   - If the limit is reached, users must delete old builds before uploading new ones.  
   - A **warning message** will be displayed when the limit is exceeded:  
     *"Upload limit reached for this project. Please delete older builds before uploading new ones."*  

5. **Device Lab Installation:**  
   - Uploaded builds can be installed on lab devices for manual and automation testing.  
   - Ensures correct deployment on Android and iOS devices.  

6. **Tester & Organization-Wide Distribution:**  
   - Builds can be shared with testers and stakeholders via organization email.  
   - Role-based access control to manage who can download or install the builds.  

7. **Build Tracking & Logs:**  
   - Dashboard to monitor uploaded builds and installation status.  
   - Logs for tracking user actions, including uploads, downloads, and installations.  

This structured system ensures **secure, project-specific build management**, controlled access, **optimized storage usage**, and seamless testing within our lab environment. ðŸš€
