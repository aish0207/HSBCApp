  v
[Initialize Biometric Check]
  - Launch the app on the emulator/device (via Appium).
  - Prepare the Frida script for hooking.
  - Ensure the app is properly installed.
  |
  v
[Appium: Trigger Biometric Check]
  - Appium triggers UI action to navigate to the authentication screen (e.g., clicking the "Login with Biometrics" button).
  - Appium waits for the biometric prompt to appear on the screen.
  |
  v
[Frida: Check Biometric Availability]
  - Hook `BiometricManager.canAuthenticate()` using Frida to check if biometric authentication is supported.
    |
    +---> BIOMETRIC_SUCCESS (Supported & Enabled) --> Go to [Proceed to Authentication]
    |
    +---> BIOMETRIC_ERROR_NONE_ENROLLED (Biometric not set up) --> Go to [Enable Biometrics]
    |
    +---> BIOMETRIC_ERROR_NO_HARDWARE (No Biometric Hardware) --> Go to [Alternative Authentication]
  |
  v
[Proceed to Authentication]  
  - Use `BiometricPrompt.authenticate()` method to initiate biometric authentication (via Appium).
  - Appium waits for biometric prompt UI.
  - Frida hooks into `authenticate()` to simulate biometric input or modify behavior:
    |
    +---> Force success by calling `onAuthenticationSucceeded()` callback (simulate success).
    |
    +---> Force failure by calling `onAuthenticationFailed()` callback (simulate failure).
  |
  v
[Enable Biometrics] (if Biometric not set up)
  - Check if biometric hardware is available.
  - Use Frida to modify system settings (via `Settings.Secure.putInt()`):
    - Set `biometric_enabled` to `1` to enable biometrics.
  - Verify if the settings change is applied.
  - Appium triggers a retry for biometric authentication (via `BiometricPrompt.authenticate()`).
  |
  v
[Alternative Authentication]
  - If biometrics are not available or not set up, fallback to alternative authentication methods.
  - Appium simulates entering password or PIN on the screen.
  |
  v
[Frida: Hook BiometricPrompt.authenticate()]
  - Intercept `BiometricPrompt.authenticate()` method:
    - Hook `AuthenticationCallback.onAuthenticationSucceeded()`.
    - Hook `AuthenticationCallback.onAuthenticationFailed()`.
  |
  v
[Simulate Authentication Success/Failure]
  - Inject code to simulate the biometric authentication result:
    |
    +---> Simulate success: call `onAuthenticationSucceeded()` and log result.
    |
    +---> Simulate failure: call `onAuthenticationFailed()` and log result.
  |
  v
[Appium: Validate Authentication]
  - Verify if the app proceeds after biometric authentication.
  - If success:
    - Check if the app navigates to the correct screen (e.g., home screen).
    - Log successful authentication.
  - If failure:
    - Check if the app falls back to alternative authentication.
    - Log failure and report issues.
  |
  v
[Test Biometrics on Different Devices/OS]
  - Appium tests biometric authentication across multiple devices/emulators.
  - Ensure Frida hooks and modifications work consistently on all devices.
  |
  v
[Inject Frida Script for Testing]
  - Use command:
    ```bash
    frida -U -n <app_package_name> -s biometric_hooks.js
    ```
  - Observe app behavior:
    - Does the app proceed after biometric prompt?
    - Does it trigger the success callback (`onAuthenticationSucceeded()`) correctly?
    - Does it handle failures by triggering the failure callback (`onAuthenticationFailed()`)?
  |
  v
[Verify Test Results]
  - Check if the biometric authentication process works on different devices.
  - Ensure fallback mechanism works if biometrics are not supported or enrolled.
  |
  v
+------------[Test Successful?]------------+
|                  YES                     |                    NO
|                                           |
v                                           v
[SUCCESS]                                [Debug Issues]
  - App authenticated                     - Check hooking points in Frida.
  - Biometric logic works as intended.     - Are `authenticate()` and `onAuthenticationSucceeded()` hooked properly?
                                           - Are Frida callbacks triggered correctly?
                                           - Debug Frida script for issues.
