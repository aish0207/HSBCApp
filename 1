- MacOS: `.zip`
- Windows: `.exe` or `.zip`

## **6. Project Settings**
During the upload process, you can configure the following settings:

## **7. Updating an App**
- **Replacing an Existing Build:** Upload the same build with the same version; it will override the previous version without creating a new app version.

## **8. Symbols or Mapping Files**
- **Purpose:** Essential for debugging and analyzing crash reports.
- **Usage:** If using the API for upload, attach symbol or mapping files to your build for easier retrieval.
