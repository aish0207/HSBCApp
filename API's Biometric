BiometricPrompt API
Introduced in: Android 9 (API level 28)
Purpose: A unified and modern API that supports biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint, face recognition, or iris scanning).
Backward Compatibility: Through the AndroidX Biometric library, it can support devices running API level 23 (Android 6) and higher.

BiometricManager API
Introduced in: Android 10 (API level 29)
Purpose: Used to determine if the device supports biometric authentication and whether the enrolled biometric data is sufficient.

KeyguardManager API
Introduced in: Android 1.0 (API level 1)
Extended Biometric Support From: Android 5.0 (API level 21)
Purpose: Manages device-level secure lock screens and allows app integration for PIN, password, or pattern authentication as a fallback to biometric prompts.

FingerprintManager API
Introduced in: Android 6 (API level 23)
Purpose: Provides fingerprint-based authentication. It has been largely superseded by the BiometricPrompt API for modern biometric needs.
